                                            Paid dating websites usually offer free registration with limited access to their dating features. If the users are satisfied with the dating platform, they can become paying users and then get access to all possibilities and features of the website. <br><br> Although it is quite alluring to only register to the free dating websites, these free dating platforms do not have the same quality and safety requirements as paid ones.Dating websites with 'Premium' packages are especially attractive for serious individuals seeking for a long-term relationship, but also for people that are looking for dating with several members without commitments.<br><br>Have in mind that the paid dating websites often have more functions and possibilities whilst they are also more reliable for the simple reason that with free dating websites, users tend to send bulk messages in order to get in touch with as many members as possible. This may also lead to a bad male-female ratio as female users may eventually leave from the free dating websites, due to uncontrolled harassment.<br><br>Users of a paid dating website place more value on quality than on the number of contacts. Free dating websites are very suitable for users who are only looking for friendship and therefore less qualitative as paid dating websites, where you often see real success stories.

                                            There are thousands of dating sites to choose from, so you should focus on the ones that match your needs. The most important trait that differentiates dating websites is their User pool. Whilst some sites are good for casual dating, others address a niche market. Another aspect is the relationship type - dating for serious relationships vs casual dating and hookup. It is important to choose a dating site that can highly increase your chances of contacting other members that you are more likely to match with. Another important factor is the pricing - while some dating sites are free, others charge for their services, offering several payment plans and packages to choose from.<br><br>A good piece of advice would be to do your research before registering to any dating site. You can use the information brought to you by our dating experts to make sure that the choice you make is the best one for you.

                                            While there are plenty of success stories when it comes to online dating, it’s clear there are still risks and you should protect yourself in the same way you would with any other online activity. Follow these tips to stay safe:<br><br>1. Get to know the person, not the profile and ask plenty of questions - don’t rush into an online relationship or meetings.<br><br>2. Never send money to someone you’ve met online, no matter what reason they give or how long you've been speaking to them.<br><br>3. Don’t move the conversation off the dating site messenger until you’re confident the person is whom they say they are.<br><br>4. Ensure you use a strong password for your online dating profile.

                                            As soon as the registration is complete, the adventure begins and it is time to communicate with other members. Remember to complete your profile with as much information as possible and use a nice profile picture. The first impression really matters as you don't get a second chance to attract someone's interest. Avoid the dull and monotonous 'Hi, how are you?'<br><br>Use a more unique and personalized message to introduce yourself. Be real, explain why you are attracted to this profile instead of others, and express your expectations. In addition, you should <br><br>avoid using repetitive introductory messages, and adjust them to each member you are writing to. Be careful with your spelling and feel free to take chances! After all, all members are registered for the same purpose: to meet people.

                                            The term “safety” includes two very important parameters. The first one refers to the safety of your personal data such as your name, contact, and payment information. It is important to check that the dating website has terms & conditions as they set the rules and guidelines that users must agree to and follow in order to use and access their website. If you cannot find terms & conditions then this is a red flag.<br><br>The second safety parameter refers to your personal safety. In this case, we advise you to be as aware and alert as you would be in real life meetings. Despite the fact that online dating is considered safe in general, there are people that might try to take advantage of you or are simply annoying members. In this case, you should make sure to only arrange meetings in public places, and inform someone close to you when you will meet someone new. Dispose of your private information safely and do not give any personal information out in the first message.
